# elx [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/elx.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.com/package/elx) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/elx.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.com/package/elx) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/egoist/elx/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://circleci.com/gh/egoist/elx)

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save elx
```

## Usage

```js
import {elx} from 'elx'

// a counter in 4 lines
elx('button', 0)
  .fromDOMEvent('click', 1)
  .reduce((state, received) => state + received)
  .subscribe((el, state) => el.textContent = state)
```

## Concepts

### Initial State

Every element has its initial state.

```js
// for the counter example
const initialState = 0
const source = elx('button', initialState)
```

### Handler for events

Notify your element with some data, of course it does not know how to handle the data for now.

```js
source.fromDOMEvent('click', 1)
```

Sure the event handler can be a function or even a Promise that resolves the data.

```js
source.fromDOMEvent('click', () => {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(1)
  }, 1000))
})
```

### Handler for actions

Abosolutely you can use custom actions, because you need cross-element communications!

```js
source.fromAction('increment', 1)
```

If you are using custom action, you can use `source.dispatch(action)` to trigger that action!

### Reducer

Tell your element how to get the new state after received data from event hander.

```js
// since it's just a counter
// we simply add the received data in event handler
// to the currentState 
const reducer = (currentState, received) => currentState + received
source.reduce(reducer)
```

### Subscribe

Trigger when element's state got changed.

```js
source.subscribe((el, newState) => {
  el.textContent = newState
})
```
